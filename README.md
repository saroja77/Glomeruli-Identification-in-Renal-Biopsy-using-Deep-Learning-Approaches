##Abstract
Deep learning algorithms are having a significant influence on the health sector. The digitization of biopsy data in the form of Whole slide images (WSIs) has enabled the automation of illness prediction and detection in the human body. One use of deep learning in healthcare is the identification of Glomeruli. Glomeruli are blood vessel clusters that enter the kidneys and act as blood filters. Each kidney has around one million Glomeruli. Glomerulosclerosis is a sign of a number of chronic and end-stage renal disorders. Glomerulosclerosis is a type of renal damage induced by scarring of the Glomeruli, which is referred to be sclerotic in nature. Typically, glomerular disorders cause glomerular damage by allowing protein and red blood cells to seep into urine. It is a sign of a number of chronic and end-stage renal disorders. Identification of sclerotic Glomeruli helps in assessing the functioning of the kidneys and can aid nephropathology research. The manual identification and classification of Glomeruli from microscopy images requires highly trained experts and is manual, labor intensive and nonstandardized. The counting of Glomeruli is a tedious and time consuming process. Hence, there is a need for automation in this field which can be addressed with the help of state of the art segmentation and classification algorithms. This paper proposes a UNet based segmentation model followed by an Inception V3 architecture for the classification of Glomeruli into sclerosed and normal. Comparison with other UNet architectures is carried out and the results show that our system has performed better achieving an overall accuracy of about 96%.
